            <td>The Arizona State University (ASU) point-shaving scandal began with Benny Silman, a former ASU student who had moved on to run a bookmaking operation on the campus. Silman used his connections and knowledge of the college basketball world to get involved in illegal gambling. As a bookmaker, Silman offered students the chance to make money by influencing the outcomes of games.

            <td><h2> Prison Sentences </h2></td>
            <td> The scandal caused major shockwaves in the world of college basketball and led to serious legal consequences. After the illegal activity was uncovered, several of the people involved were arrested and charged with crimes related to the point-shaving scheme. Joseph Gagliano was sentenced to 15 months in prison for his role in the operation. Other individuals, including players, also faced legal trouble, and the entire ASU basketball program was tainted by the scandal. This event damaged the reputation of ASU’s basketball team and served as a stark reminder of how illegal gambling can destroy careers and the integrity of sports. The scandal led to lasting changes in how college athletics were monitored and brought attention to the dangers of corruption and the pressure that some athletes may face. Gagliano’s prison sentence was just one part of the broader fallout from this major college sports scandal. </td>

        <tr><td><h2>Rule Changes In College Sports</h2></td>
          <td>The NCAA has a strict zero-tolerance policy when it comes to gambling and point shaving. This means that any player involved in these activities faces serious consequences, including losing their eligibility to play college sports. For someone like Steven, this became a huge obstacle in his basketball career. He was a talented player, but when the scandal surrounding gambling and point shaving became public, it damaged his reputation. As a result, no NBA teams were willing to take a chance on him. They didn’t tolerate any form of dishonesty or unethical behavior, and this incident made them question his character and integrity. Unfortunately, despite his skills, Steven was unable to make it into the NBA because the teams simply did not want to risk bringing someone on who had been involved in such a serious issue. The consequences of the scandal followed him throughout his career, and it ultimately cost him the opportunity to play at the highest level.
